Turn off the xbox 360 controller 'CAUSE MICROSOFT NEVER PUT A "TURN OFF CONTROLLER" BUTTON ON WINDOWS.
Simply open the .exe file and BAAAMMMM! ALL CONTROLLERS ARE NOW OFF!

HEY! the "xinput.h" header file is avaiable here: https://github.com/glfw/glfw/blob/master/deps/mingw/xinput.h





*Feel free to NOT use this program on your shitty OS, microsoft.*
